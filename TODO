1) Update 'AboutWebView'. Should we replace WebView with a Label's 'ActiveText' feature?
2) Fix MediaPlayer. Problem described here: http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Cascades-Development/MediaPlayer-prepare-Error-attaching-input-source/m-p/2012985#M7380
3) Fix the support page and "mailto" links
4) Add another tab with 'hidden' images. User should open 3 similar images to 'win'.
